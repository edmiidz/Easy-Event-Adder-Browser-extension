# Easy-Event-Adder-Browser-extension

Have you ever been on a website, that makes mention of an event, but there is no easy export-to-calendar icon or button there?
This chrome extension will parse the page and create a suggested:
tile, body, start time and duration, Plus include a link back to the source of the event.
